<div id=i11><h3>CULTURE</h3><hr color=#0099ff></div>

<div id=i12><p align=justify>Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years. During the Vedic period (c. 1700 – 500 BCE),
 the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology,theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist
 today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mok?a, were established.India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, 
Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions. The predominant religion, Hinduism,
 has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads, theYoga Sutras, the Bhakti 
movement, and by Buddhist philosophy.<br><br>
<b><u>Art and architecture</u></b><br><br>
Much of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other works of Mughal architecture, and South Indian architecture, blends 
ancient local traditions with imported styles. Vernacular architecture is also highly regional in it flavours. Vastu shastra,
 literally "science of construction" or "architecture" and ascribed to Mamuni Mayan, explores how the laws of nature affect
 human dwellings; it employs precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic constructs. As 
applied in Hindu temple architecture, it is influenced by the Shilpa Shastras, a series of foundational texts whose basic mythological 
form is the Vastu-Purusha mandala, a square that embodied the "absolute".The Taj Mahal, built in Agra between 1631 and
 1648 by orders of Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, has been described in the UNESCO World Heritage List as "the jewel
 of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage".Indo-Saracenic Revival
 architecture, developed by the British in the late 19th century, drew on Indo-Islamic architecture.<br><br>
<b><u>Literature</u></b><br><br>
The earliest literary writings in India, composed between 1700 BCE and 1200 CE, were in the Sanskrit language. 
Prominent works of this Sanskrit literature include epics such as theMahabharata and the Ramayana, the dramas of Kalidasa
 such as the Abhijnanasakuntalam (The Recognition of Sakuntala), and poetry such as the Mahakavya.Kamasutra,
 the famous book about sexual intercourse also originated in India. Developed between 600 BCE and 300 CE in South India, the
 Sangam literature, consisting of 2,381 poems, is regarded as a predecessor of Tamil literature.From the 
14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of
 devotional poets such as Kabir, Tulsidas, and Guru Nanak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of 
thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.
 In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, 
Indian literature was influenced by the works of Bengali poet and novelist Rabindranath Tagore.<br><br>
<u><b>Performing arts</b></u><br><br>
Indian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres and their various folk
 offshoots: the northernHindustani and southern Carnatic schools.Regionalised popular forms include filmi and folk music;
 the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms.
 Among the better-known folk dances are the bhangra of Punjab, the bihu of Assam, the chhau of Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand,
 garba and dandiya of Gujarat, ghoomar of Rajasthan, and the lavani of Maharashtra. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms 
and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. 
These are: bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu, kathak of Uttar Pradesh, kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala, kuchipudi 
of Andhra Pradesh, manipuri of Manipur, odissi of Odisha, and the sattriya of Assam.Theatre in India melds music, dance,
 and improvised or written dialogue.Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances or social
 and political events, Indian theatre includes the bhavai of Gujarat, the jatra of West Bengal, the nautanki and ramlila of North India,
 tamasha of Maharashtra, burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh, terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu, and the yakshagana of Karnataka.<br><br>
<b><u>Motion pictures, television</u></b><br><br>
The Indian film industry produces the world's most-watched cinema.Established regional cinematic traditions exist in the
 Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi,Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, and Telugu languages.South
 Indian cinema attracts more than 75% of national film revenue.
Television broadcasting began in India in 1959 as a state-run medium of communication, and had slow expansion for more than
 two decades.The state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s and, since then, satellite channels have 
increasingly shaped popular culture of Indian society.Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry
 estimates indicate that as of 2012 there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462 million with satellite and/or cable connections, 
compared to other forms of mass media such as press (350 million), radio (156 million) or internet (37 million).
